class SequenceToVector(nn.Module):

    It is an abstract class defining SequenceToVector enocoder
    abstraction. To build you own SequenceToVector encoder, subclass
    this.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_dim : ``str``
        Last dimension of the input input vector sequence that
        this SentenceToVector encoder will encounter.

        Forward pass of Main Classifier.

        Parameters
        ----------
        vector_sequence : ``torch.Tensor``
            Sequence of embedded vectors of shape (batch_size, max_tokens_num, embedding_dim)
        sequence_mask : ``torch.Tensor``
            Boolean tensor of shape (batch_size, max_tokens_num). Entries with 1 indicate that
            token is a real token, and 0 indicate that it's a padding token.
        training : ``bool``
            Whether this call is in training mode or prediction mode.
            This flag is useful while applying dropout because dropout should
            only be applied during training.

        Returns
        -------
        An output dictionary consisting of:
        combined_vector : torch.Tensor
            A tensor of shape ``(batch_size, embedding_dim)`` representing vector
            compressed from sequence of vectors.
        layer_representations : torch.Tensor
            A tensor of shape ``(batch_size, num_layers, embedding_dim)``.
            For each layer, you typically have (batch_size, embedding_dim) combined
            vectors. This is a stack of them.
